## Project Description
This project implements a basic **Login** and **Signup** functionality using React. The app allows users to register an account and log in securely, with robust API handling for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- User registration with validation
- User login with session handling
- Error handling for invalid inputs or server errors
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views
- **Improved API handling**:
  - Used `async/await` for better readability and asynchronous operations.
  - Wrapped API calls in `try-catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully.

## Additional Enhancements
- Password strength indicator during signup
- Persistent user session using localStorage/sessionStorage
- Form validation with error messages for real-time feedback

## Approach
- Followed a component-based architecture for modular and reusable code.
- Used `React Router` for navigation between Login and Signup pages.
- Implemented state management using React's `useState` and `useContext` hooks.
- Validated form inputs using custom validation functions.
- Leveraged `fetch` or `axios` for API communication with structured error handling.
